# Challenges Overview
## Challenge 3: Adding and Removing Elements
In this challenge, you'll get familiar with the basic operations for adding and removing individual elements in a set. You'll use methods like .add(), .remove(), and .discard() to manipulate the elements of the set.

### Objective:
Add elements 6 and 7 to an existing set.

Remove the element 2 from the set.

Print the updated set to verify the changes.

### Key Methods:
.add(element) - Adds a single element to the set.

.remove(element) - Removes an element from the set. If the element is not found, it raises a KeyError.

.discard(element) - Removes an element from the set, but it does not raise an error if the element does not exist.
