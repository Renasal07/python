This is my pseudocode:

# Challenge 7: Sets vs Lists
* This challenge demonstrates the key differences between sets and lists in Python, specifically how sets automatically handle duplicates and are unordered.

## Objective:
* Create a list containing duplicate values. 
* Convert the list to a set to eliminate duplicates. 
* Print both the original list and the set to compare them.

## Key Points:
* Lists allow duplicate elements and maintain the order of insertion.
* Sets automatically remove duplicate elements and are unordered.
