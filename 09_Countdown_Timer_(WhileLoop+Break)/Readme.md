This is my pseudocode:


* Store the score in variable called 'count' by taking the user input
* Continue looping while count is greater than 0
* Print the current countdown number
* Decrease the countdown variable by 1
* Prompt the user to stop or continue
* print "Enter "stop" to cancel or press Enter:"
* check if the user entered "stop"
* Notify the user the countdown has stopped
* Exit/break out of the loop
* After the loop ends, the program exits

End
