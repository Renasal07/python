# Hangman Game: Python Edition

Welcome to the **Hangman Game: Python Edition**! This is a simple, fun word-guessing game where you try to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters. But be carefulâ€”if you make too many wrong guesses, the hangman is drawn, and you lose the game!

## Game Rules

1. You will be given a word with missing letters.
2. You will guess one letter at a time.
3. If you guess a letter that is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position.
4. If you guess a wrong letter, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
5. You can make **6 wrong guesses** before the game is over.
6. The game ends when either:
   - You guess all the letters correctly (you win!).
   - Or you make 6 wrong guesses (you lose!).

## How to Play

1. The game will start by giving you a random word to guess.
2. It will show blanks (`_`) for each letter in the word, and you will guess one letter at a time.
3. If you guess a letter correctly, it will appear in the word.
4. If you guess a letter incorrectly, the hangman figure will be drawn bit by bit.
5. You have **6 chances** to make a wrong guess before the hangman is fully drawn.
6. After the game ends, you can choose to play again.
