This is my pseudo code:


* Store the score in variable called 'num' by taking the user input
* Loop through numbers from 1 to 10
  * 11 is exclusive, so it loops from 1 to 10
* Check if the number is even
* if num % 2 == 0:
  * continue skip this iteration for even numbers
    * Print the number if it is odd
      * print "num"

End
