This is my psedu code:

* print "please input your score"
store the score in variable called 'store' by taking the user input
If the score is greater than or equal to 90:
* Print "Grade: A"
Else if the score is between 80 and 89 (inclusive):
* Print "Grade: B"
Else if the score is between 70 and 79 (inclusive):
* Print "Grade: C"
Else if the score is between 60 and 69 (inclusive):
* Print "Grade: D"
Else (if the score is below 60):
* Print "Grade: F"

End
