This is my pseudocode:

* Print "please enter a number"
    * Store the score in variable called 'number' by taking the user input
* Check if the number is even or odd. 
* If the number is even (i.e., divisible by 2)
    * print: `"The number is even."`
* If the number is odd, 
    * print: `"The number is odd."`

End
