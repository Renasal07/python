This is my pseudocode:

## Code Overview

The code performs the following tasks:
1. Creates a tuple containing five different elements: an integer, a float, a string, a boolean, and a nested tuple.
2. Prints the entire tuple.
3. Accesses and prints the third element of the tuple.
4. Extracts the nested tuple and prints its first element.
