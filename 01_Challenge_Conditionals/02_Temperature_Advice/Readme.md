This is my pseudocode:

* print("Enter the current temperature (in Celsius)")
    * store the score in variable called 'temperature' by taking the user input
* Use conditional statements to give advice based on the temperature. 

* If the temperature is below 10°C, 
    * print: `"It's cold outside. Wear a jacket!"`
      * elif the temperature is between 10°C and 25°C, 
        * print: `"It's a nice day. Wear short-sleeves!"`
        * print: `"It's hot outside. Stay cool!"`

End
