This is my pseudocode:

* Print "please enter the current day of the week"
    * Store the score in variable called 'day' by taking the user input
* If the day is "Monday", print: `"Start your week with a workout!"`
* If the day is "Tuesday", print: `"It's a great day to read a book!"`
* If the day is "Wednesday", print: `"Mid-week movie night!"`
* If the day is "Thursday", print: `"Try a new recipe!"`
* If the day is "Friday", print: `"Relax and enjoy the weekend!"`
* If the day is "Saturday", print: `"Go for a hike!"`
* If the day is "Sunday", print: `"Prepare for the week ahead with some self-care."`

End
