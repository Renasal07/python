This is my pseudocode:

## Overview

* Simple Python program that counts how many times a fruit appears in a list.

* List of fruits is stored in a tuple (a type of collection in Python).

* User is asked to enter a fruit name.

* The program counts how many times that fruit appears in the tuple and shows the result.

* Great for beginners to practice:
    * User input 
    * Tuples 
    * Counting occurrences in a list
