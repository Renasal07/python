### This is my pseudocode:

# Challenge 2: Unique Words in a Sentence

## Overview
* This task uses Python sets to extract unique words from a sentence. 
* Sets remove duplicates automatically, making it easy to find distinct words.

## Task

* sentence = "The quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog‚Äù

## Steps:

1. Split the sentence into words.
2. Convert the list to a set.
3. Print the set of unique words.

## Sample Output

{'The', 'quick', 'brown', fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog'}


## Note: 
'The' and 'the' are counted as different words due to case sensitivity.
