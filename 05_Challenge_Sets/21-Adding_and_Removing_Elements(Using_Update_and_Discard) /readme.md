This is my pseudocode:

# Challenge 6: Adding and Removing Elements (Using Update and Discard)
* In this challenge, you will learn how to update a set with multiple elements at once and safely discard elements without raising errors, even if the element does not exist.

## Objective:
* Add multiple elements to a set using the .update() method. 
* Safely remove an element using the .discard() method. 
* Print the updated set.

## Key Methods:
* .update(iterable) - Adds all elements from the given iterable (e.g., list, tuple, set) to the set.
* .discard(element) - Removes the element from the set if it exists, but does not raise an error if the element is not found.
