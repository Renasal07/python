This is my pseudocode:

# Challenge 4: Set Operations
This challenge focuses on set operations such as union, intersection, and difference, which are used to combine and compare sets.

## Objective:
* Create two sets, set1 and set2, and perform the following operations:
* Union: Combines all unique elements from both sets. 
* Intersection: Returns elements that are common to both sets. 
* Difference: Returns elements that are in the first set but not in the second.

## Key Methods:
* .union(other_set) - Returns a new set containing all elements from both sets (without duplicates). 
* .intersection(other_set) - Returns a new set containing only the elements found in both sets. 
* .difference(other_set) - Returns a new set containing elements from the first set that are not in the second set.
