This is my pseudocode:

# Challenge 5: Set Methods
* This challenge explores various set methods such as .copy(), .clear(), and .pop() which allow you to work with sets more effectively.

## Objective:
* Copy an existing set into another set. 
* Pop a random element from the set, removing it. 
* Clear the entire set.

## Key Methods:
* .copy() - Returns a shallow copy of the set. 
* .pop() - Removes and returns a random element from the set. 
* .clear() - Removes all elements from the set, leaving it empty.
